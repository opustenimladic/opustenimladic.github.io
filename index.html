    <h2>
      Gaming has fallen low
    </h2>
      <p>It doesn't take a genius to see how low has gaming fallen in general.
      Addictive gameplay, skinnerbox reward systems, degenerate youth coupled with 
      bug filled product and numerous bad decisions by the companies has lead me to aquire more cynical view on games today.
      </p>
      <p>I am looking for specific type and that's why I exclude 99% games out there.</p>
      <p>But no matter how good it is if the community is filled wtih toxicity.
        That's why I created this small group, so we can still enjoy some good games in peace and quiete.</p>
